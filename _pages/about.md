Hi! I am Shiyuan (Sean) Zhang, a Visiting Research Assistant at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), with guidance of Prof. [Jieyu Zhao](https://jyzhao.net/). I earned my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Statistics and Computer Science from the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), worked closely with Prof. [Jiaqi Ma](https://jiaqima.github.io/). My research interest focus on data-centric machine learning (e.g., data attribution), trustworthy NLP, LLM for recommendations, and vision-language models.

Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring trading, where I find the unpredictability of the markets both humbling and exhilarating. I also share my quiet late nights with [Lulu](/assets/img/lulu.jpg), a white rag who has been a silent witness to many of my coding sessions and research explorations.
